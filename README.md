#This project is a multi-client chat application using Java Sockets, enabling real-time messaging over TCP/IP. The server listens for client connections, creates a separate thread for each, and broadcasts messages using I/O streams (BufferedReader, PrintWriter). The client reads user input (Scanner), sends it to the server, and listens for incoming messages. Synchronization (Set<PrintWriter>) ensures thread safety.
